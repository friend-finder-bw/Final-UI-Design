          <h4>Another FAQ?</h4>
          <p class='img1'>Take a look at the chart to the left.  After review the survey showing Dunba's theory, at 
            Friend Finder, believe we have the ability to maxamize, not only the potential amount of 
            friends that you can have, but also how close you can become with them.  We so many personality 
          tests and other ways understand how we work on an indiviual level based on our needs, data such as 
          this and much more allows us to hone in and make the best matches possible.</p>
